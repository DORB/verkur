Verkur 1.0
==========
Manual

The idea of Verkur is to maintain a list of people which
you can add to, delete from, sort and search. The changes
will be saved to a text file stored along the program.

The available commands are thus:

'add':  Add a person to the list.
		User will be prompted for
        the addition.

'del':  Delete a person from the list.
		User will be prompted which person to delete. If the
		number of the person to be deleted is already known,
		user can also use the syntax 'del number', for example
		'del 5' to delete person with the number 5 in the list.

'list': Shows the list. No other options.

'find': Finds a person in the list.
		User will be prompted for a search string. Otherwise
		it is also possible to give a parameter straight
		after 'find', for example 'find search string' would
		search for the string 'search string' and show
		the persons with names containing the search string.

'sort': Sorts the list.
		Options are:
		(1) By names
		(2) By Year of Birth
		(3) By Year of Death
		(4) By Sex
		User will be prompted for a way to order the list.
		Otherwise it is also possible to give parameters
		straight after 'sort', for example 'sort 3'.
		Appending a 'd' will show the list in descending order.
		For example: 'sort 3 d' will show the list, ordered
		by year of death in a descending order.

'quit': Quits the program.

'help': Shows this manual.
